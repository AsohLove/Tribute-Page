                    </li><br>
                    <li><strong>1935</strong>- Has to stop school and save up more money, Works in the Civilian Conservation
                        corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them". he said. "All of this left scars on me."
                    </li><br>
                    <li><strong>1937</strong>- Finished university and takes a job in the US Forestry</li>

                        by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding
                        pest-resistant plants.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><strong>1941</strong>- Tries to enrol in the military after the Pearl Harbour attack, but is rejected. Instead, the 
                        military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other
                        applied science.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><strong>1942</strong>- Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li><br>
                    <li><strong>1944</strong>- Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico
                        to head a new plant Pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,0000 different strains 
                        of disease resistant wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>1945- Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li><br>
                    <li><strong>1953</strong>- crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yielding American breed, creating a strain
                        that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><strong>1962</strong>- Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent
                        in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population
                    </li><br>
                    <li><strong>1970</strong>- receives the Noble Peace Prize </li><br>

                        sorghum yields
                    </li><br>
                    <li><strong>1984</strong>- becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li><br>
                    <li><strong>2005</strong>- states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that 
                        genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out 
                        of arabic land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically
                        modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the 
                        best breeds."
                    </li><br>
                    <li><strong>2009</strong>- dies at the age of 95</li><br>

                man's towering intellect, persistence and scientific vision can make to human peace and progress."
